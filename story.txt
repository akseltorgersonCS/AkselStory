Once upon a time there was a man named Billy.
Billy was an alright student, however, he had no motivation.
BIlly would often lay in bed instead of going to CS400 lecture.
One day he woke up late and realized that he missed the first xTeam meeting!
He made up for it by meeting them as soon as possible
