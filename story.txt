Once upon a time there was a man named Billy.
Billy was an alright student, however, he had no motivation.
BIlly would often lay in bed instead of going to CS400 lecture.
One day he woke up late and realized that he missed the first xTeam meeting!
He made up for it by meeting them as soon as possible

He met them at a place called Memorial Union.
They all fomred a Discord to talk because they were too lazy to walk
any further than a few blocks to get things done.

Then he his team got a new assignment to do.
An introduction to git by making stories with each other.
Billy thought long and hard about what he should make his story about.
Suddenly he was struck with inspriation. 

He realized he can low key just randomly generate a story on the internet.
Unfortunately, billy realized UW net is trash so he had to come up with something himself.
He hopes this story ends soon because he wants to submit ASAP.

Billy loves meta jokes, especially this one because it is about himself.
Billy loves the casual shade being thrown by his partners, he is always down for some friendly
banter. He is excited to actually  use git hub to program, not just write silly stories that
no one else will really ever see.

The end.
